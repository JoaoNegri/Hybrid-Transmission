# Hybrid Transmission Protocol ‚Äî Firmware (ESP32)

This directory contains an firmware implementation of the **Hybrid Transmission (HT)** protocol for embedded devices based on ESP32 with LoRaWAN communication.

HT is a protocol that increases communication reliability by using both message repetition and erasure-coded messages, which allow for recovering lost packets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

This implementation uses an **ESP32 Dev Module** connected to a **LoRaWAN Bee V2** module.

The LoRa communication is handled using the library provided by RoboCore:  
[RoboCore_SMW-SX1276M0](https://github.com/RoboCore/RoboCore_SMW-SX1276M0)

Messages are transmitted to [The Things Network (TTN)](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), which acts as a LoRaWAN gateway and application server.

## üìê Protocol Header Structure

The figure below shows the structure of the HT protocol header:

In this example, the 13th message is being transmitted. It is of type ‚Äúinformation,‚Äù with 5 repetitions, a coding window of 4 messages, and 3 coded message transmissions.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Build and Upload

To compile and upload the firmware, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-user/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**.

3. Install the **PlatformIO IDE** extension.

4. If PlatformIO does not initialize properly, try restarting VSCode a few times.

5. In the PlatformIO menu, run the **Build** task:

6. Connect your **ESP32 Dev Module** via USB and run the **Upload** task.

7. When the message `Connecting...` appears in the terminal, briefly press the **BOOT** button on the ESP32.  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Do not hold the button for more than a few seconds, or the device may reset.
